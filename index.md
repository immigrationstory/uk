# Hello and welcome.

You're probably here because either you are planning to immigrate, or you already are in the process of immigrating to and settling in the United Kingdom.

Congratulations. The UK is a beautiful country filled with wonderfully diverse people who value tradition, ingenuity, and hard work.

Like you, I and my partner have embarked on that long journey to move to this country. Immigration is not a process that I can call "easy" -- especially in the UK, there are very high bars to reach and this can be viewed by some as highly unforgiving -- however, with proper planning and foresight you can make it manageable. We've documented our experiences here in hopes that it will guide you and help you prepare for what lies ahead.

In addition to showing the steps we've taken (and their outcomes), we'll also share with you:

0. Any useful document templates we've found or made ourselves
0. Tools that we think will be useful
0. Breakdowns of fees and costs that we've paid
0. Links to relevant laws and other official guidance

All the chapters are listed below detailing what we've gone through since 2014 (which was when we started planning to immigrate to the UK) up to the present day in 2020 (as of the time of writing) which is when we have received our permanent residency, otherwise known as the ILR.

I urge you to read through the chapters in sequence, but if you'd like to start somewhere in the middle, feel free to jump straight to a topic of interest -- just know that you may need to go back to refer to prior chapters where I detail all the preparation that has been done to get to that point.
