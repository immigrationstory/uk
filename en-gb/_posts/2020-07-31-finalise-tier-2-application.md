## Final checks
Once we had completed all of the requirements on our end, we informed PwC that we are ready for the final checks for our application.

They then went through the application and all of our supporting documents to make sure that everything is in good order. Given the amount of preparation we've done, we didn't expect any issues to be raised off the back of this final review, and indeed they have confirmed that we are nearly ready to submit the application.

## Certificate of Sponsorship

As the final checks were successful, PwC informed the company sponsoring us that they can now proceed assigning the certificate of sponsorship. Once done, the company provided us a PDF showing the details of the certificate, which we checked to ensure that all the details are correct and is what we expected.

## Submitting and paying for the application
As we now have the final requirement (the certificate of sponsorship) in hand, we entered the details of the certificate in the visa application form and performed a check prior to submission. Given that everything is in order, we proceeded with the submission and the payment.

We submitted the visa application on 16 May 2015 and paid for it on the same day. Back in 2015 the cost was £1,128.00 per person; as we were applying from the Philippines we were charged in USD, the final amount at the time was US$‎1,760.00 per person (or US$3,520.00 altogether for me and my spouse). Payments for each applicant are made separately, and not together.
