## Limits as a Tier 2 (General) visa holder
As our Tier 2 leave[^leave] to remain was granted with the full duration of five years (thus more than six months) there normally are no limits as to how long of a time we can spend outside of the UK, provided I continue to work for the same employer who sponsored us and we do not spend a continuous period of more than two years outside the Common Travel Area[^common-travel-area].

[^leave]: "Leave" here means "permission"; thus "leave to remain" is your "permission to remain" in the UK

After acquiring the appropriate visas (Schengen visa in this case), my spouse and I were able to travel for holidays to various locations in Europe, such as the Netherlands, France, Monaco, and Spain. My employer also additionally sponsored visas for us as there was an occasional need to conduct business in other countries such as Belgium, Germany, Latvia, and Italy, as part of my responsibilities.

## Planning ahead for the ILR

Despite the apparent freedom of having no time restrictions out of the UK as far as a Tier 2 visa is concerned, we knew that our next immediate goal was to settle in the UK, and that means eventually applying for an Indefinite Leave to Remain (contrasted with a Tier 2 visa which is a *limited* leave -- i.e. permission -- to remain) which will grant us permanent residency.

In accordance with the requirements for an ILR, we maintained a spreadsheet which carefully tracked all our travels outside the country. We made very sure that we never spent more than 180 full days in any 12-month period outside the UK as that will cause us to fail one of the ILR's many requirements.
