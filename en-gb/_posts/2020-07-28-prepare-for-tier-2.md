## What is the Tier 2 (General) visa
The Tier 2 (General) visa is a points-based long-term work visa for migrants from outside the European Economic Area[^what-is-the-eea] (prior to Brexit) who have been offered a job in the UK by a UK sponsor. People under the Tier 2 (General) route can eventually apply to settle to live indefinitely in the UK, unlike other visa types such the Tier 2 (Inter-Company Transfer) visa.

[^what-is-the-eea]: <https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea>

Visas are applied from and granted by UK Visas and Immigration. UKVI is part of the Home Office, a department of the UK government.

As of the time of writing, the UK have left the European Union and plans are under way to unify the visa routes and include people in the EEA within the points-based immigration system. This means that the free movement of people from the EEA will end and everyone will now need to apply and pay for visas (unless the EU and the UK will come up with an agreement allowing a modified form of freedom of movement), like the citizens of other non-EEA countries prior to Brexit.

The "tier" signifies broad classifications of points-based UK visas, of which there are four kinds as of the time of writing:

* Tier 1 visas are for investors, business development, and talent
* Tier 2 visas are for those seeking to work in the UK long-term
* Tier 4 visas are for those seeking to study in the UK
* Tier 5 visas are for those seeking to work in the UK short-term

Notice that "Tier 3" visas are not mentioned -- originally this was intended to be a visa for unskilled migrants, but was never implemented and was discontinued as the government felt that there was no need for unskilled immigration from outside the European Economic Area.

The UK also has a non-points-based system for other kinds of visas; the full list and guidance can be found at [the UK Government's Visas and Immigration page](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration).

It is very important that you know what route you are applying under, and you fully understand the requirements of that route. Not doing so could lead to a rejection of your application, with no refund of any fees paid.

## Starting the application process
![](/assets/visa-application.jpg)

A few days after I've formally accepted the job offer in February 2015, I was informed by the company that they will now be kicking-off the visa process for me and partner.

As part of the support that came with the job offer, the company sponsoring us to come to the UK have procured the services of a firm to help us with the legal process of immigration. In our case, this service was provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), who had a team of legal professionals knowledgeable in both the Philippine and the UK systems and laws. They reached out to us and guided us through the entire process of getting the right documents to fulfil requirements as well as filling the right forms correctly. They were also available for any questions that we may have had regarding our circumstances.

Given the number of requirements and the amount of information needed we were told very clearly that the application process is not something that we should expect to complete in one day. We then started the online application process, ensuring that we save our progress regularly, taking note of items that we were required to submit as indicated in the form. We were instructed to *not* submit the application until they've had a chance to review it.

Applications are made directly on [the UK Government's website online](https://www.gov.uk/tier-2-general/apply). Appointment bookings are made on the website of the company the UKVI has partnered with for your country; e.g. for the Philippines it was [VFS Global](https://www.vfsglobal.co.uk/ph/en). You should book an appointment after your visa application is paid for and submitted.

Be sure to be aware of the timelines and lead times when requesting for pertinent documents from your current and previous employers, your university, certification bodies, and local government registries. Required and supporting documents should be available for review by you and/or your prospective employer's appointed firm well before the target application date.
